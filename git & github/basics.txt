Stashing is a way to save your uncommitted changes temporarily so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later.

git stash => to stash your changes
git stash list => to see all stashed changes
git stash apply => to re-apply the most recent stash
git stash apply stash@{n} => to re-apply a specific stash
git stash drop stash@{n} => to delete a specific stash
git stash pop => to re-apply the most recent stash and remove it from the stash list
git stash clear => to delete all stashes
git stash save "message" => to stash changes with a message
git stash branch <branch_name> => to create a new branch from a stash and apply the stash to it
git stash show => to see the changes in the most recent stash
git stash show -p => to see the full diff of the most recent stash
